When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with others, or from different computers. Also to avoid lose of data
    in case of a failure in mi local system.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To mantain control about what is being commited. As GitHub is public,
    maybe I don't want some commits to be uploaded as the are not
    finished work or not functional.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are within GitHub environment. Clones can be in you computer,
    between computers or between GitHub and the local machine.
    Branches are splits from the design.
    I would use a branch for testing experimental features on my project.
    Instead, I would use clone for copying the code from location to another.
    Finally, I would use fork for cloning a repository in GitHub to
    my profile
